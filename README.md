# Piscine Reloaded

Welcome to the Piscine Reloaded project! The goal of this project is to provide you with a refreshed and enhanced version of the foundational coding exercises from the piscine (swimming pool) phase of your training at 42.

This project will help you revisit and reinforce important concepts in C programming and algorithms. By working on these exercises, you will be able to solidify your understanding and improve your coding skills.

The piscine reloaded project will include a collection of exercises that cover topics such as:
- String manipulation
- Memory allocation
- Data structures and algorithms
- File handling
- Basic I/O

As you work through the project, you will be challenged to solve increasingly complex problems and will have the opportunity to expand your knowledge and skills.

We hope that you will find this project to be a valuable experience and that it will help you continue to grow as a programmer. So, let's get started!
